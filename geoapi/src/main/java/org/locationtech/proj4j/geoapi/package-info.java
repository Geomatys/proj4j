/**
 * Wraps the PROJ4J classes behind the equivalent GeoAPI interfaces.
 * This module provides a public class, {@link org.locationtech.proj4j.geoapi.Wrappers},
 * with overloaded {@code geoapi(â€¦)} methods. Those methods expected a PROJ4J object in
 * argument and returns a view of that object as a GeoAPI type.
 *
 * <h2>Mutability</h2>
 * No information is copied. All methods of the views delegate their work to the PROJ4J implementation.
 * Consequently, since PROJ4J objects are mutable, changes to the wrapped PROJ4J object are immediately
 * reflected in the view. However, it is not recommended to change a wrapped PROJ4J object as CRS should
 * be immutable.
 *
 * <p>There is one exception to the above paragraph: whether an object is a geographic or projected <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
 * Because the type of a Java object cannot change dynamically, whether a <abbr>CRS</abbr> is geographic or projected
 * is determined at {@code geoapi(CoordinateReferenceSystem)} invocation time.</p>
